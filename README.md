PlayAndWin (PAW)

The product is an interactive website, featuring an array of games that reward the player with points based on their performance. These points can then be used in an onsite webstore which features a variety of digital (or physical) goodies, such as player badges, virtual stickers and gift cards. The purpose of these offerings is to keep players hooked on the site and in competition with their peers. To promote these social interactions as well as grow the site and gain more active users, players will also receive points for recruiting others.
Key product goals: 
The company financially benefits from this product through advertisement.
To promote sponsored companies through product placement featured in the games. Sponsorship deals can be lucrative.
Customer: 
People who are into small and short web games and earning products with their skills.
Need: 
Customers need this product for entertainment. Getting prizes and coins, and completing short little games all the time make the player feel satisfied and entertained.
Customers that want to get free stuff for the time spent playing games.
Competition: 
It is not a virtual casino and there is no loss to the customer except his/her time. This game has coins that you earn each time you play a game. The coins can be used in the web shop that offers different products, like gift cards, virtual goods or products from sponsors. Not many game sites use a coin/shop combination.
The site is safe for kids.
Primary differentiation: 
Other game sites do not offer sponsored real products. They may have virtual products to use within the same site, but not sponsored products that have value outside the site.
